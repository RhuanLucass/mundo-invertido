# Landing Page - Inverted World

This project refers to the creation of a Landing Page during Digital Innovation One (DIO) Semana Front-End with the theme of the Stranger Things series. The original Landing Page was not responsive, which was one of the aspects improved during its execution.

## Description

The main objective of this initiative was to improve front-end skills, using HTML, CSS and JS to recreate the atmosphere of the Stranger Things series. In addition to responsiveness, audiovisual elements such as audio, video and CSS/JS animations were added. The implementation of a special animation with an “upside down” effect stands out, bringing a darker theme, characteristic of the series.

## Main Features

- Implementation of responsiveness to adapt to different devices.
- Integration of audiovisual elements (audio, video) to enrich the experience.
- Animations in CSS and JS to create an “inverted” effect on the page.
- Exploration of two distinct themes characteristic of the series.
